# Bug?
yes, this apps have a bug. if u added data netizen / group using 2 words, this program will "looping forever" coz i make a change 'GetLine' in Apps, you can use 'GetLine' in the program for solve this bug, but program cant make relation between group and netizen.

use this for fix bug looping forever when added data netizen / group using 2 words

```javascript
std::cin.ignore();
std::getline(cin,res);
```

but if you use the code, the effect of the group and netizens will not be related.

Note : Hey, Help us to solve this problem. :)
